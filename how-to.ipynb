    "- R uses `install.packages()` to manage the [Library](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/10/customizing-your-package-library-location/), but users may prefer `pacman`, which also manages dependencies.[<sup>3</sup>](https://rdocumentation.org/packages/pacman/versions/0.5.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python packages and project environments are often managed by `pip`, `conda`, [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/), or containers like [Docker](https://github.com/rpy2/rpy2-docker).[<sup>4,</sup>](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/tool-recommendations/)[<sup>5</sup>](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operating Systems orgainze software like R, RStudio, and python differently. Linux distributions use different software managers such as `apt`, and Windows users may implement [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) or [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/).\n",

    "- Python packages installed via apt take precedence over pip, because pip will know packages available at pipy are installed in _/usr/lib/python?/dist-package_. apt installs python packages in dist-package seperate from site-package.[<sup>7</sup>](https://wiki.debian.org/Python#Deviations_from_upstream) When pip is itself an apt installed dist-package it also installs packages from pipy as dist-packages, however, at _local/lib_.\n",
